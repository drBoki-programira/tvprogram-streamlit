## Overview
This app displays scraped tv schedule data. 
Check it out at https://tvprogram-7-dana-unazad.streamlit.app/
## Use
You can take a quick look at the last week's schedule and rewind to the show you want to watch. I have selected a few channels to track. More could be added.
## Detailed description
It uses tv schedule data stored in a postgres db and displays it. Users can select a channel from a list and date range from seven days ago to day after day after tomorrow (it's a word in serbian). Channels are emmited in the Balkans.
